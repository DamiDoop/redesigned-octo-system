### R*EDESIGNE*D
# OC*TO*
## SYST*EM*
The redesigned octo system *knows where it is at* *all times. It knows this because it knows wher*e it isn't. By subtracting where it is from wher*e it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whic*hever is *greater)*, it obtains a *difference, or deviation. The guidance* subsystem uses *deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the redesigned octo system from a position where it is to a p*osition wh*ere it isn't, and arriving at a posit*ion where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the posi*tion where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the p*osition that it w*as, is now the pos*ition that it isn't.
In the event that the positi*on that it is in is not the position that it wa*sn't, the system has acquired *a variation, the variation being the* differe*nce between where the redesigned octo system is, an*d where it wasn't. If variation is consi*dered to be a sign*ifica*nt factor, it too may be c*orrected by the G*EA. However, the red*esigned octo system must also know where it was.
The redesigned octo system guidan*ce computer scenar*io works as follows. Beca*use a vari*ation has modified some of the infor*mation the redesigned octo system has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However,* it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from *where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and* by differenti*ating t*his from the algebr*aic s*um of where it shoul*dn't be, and wh*ere it was, it is able to obtain the dev*iation and its variation, which is called err*or.<br>
